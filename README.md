# red_scripts
This script is very simple and is only meant as a starting point. 
My idea was just to try and get a shell that would be living off the land and not get caught by windows defender. 
I dont run this as a bat file. I convert it to an .exe file. 
There are many ways to get this to get a target to execute this file. (mostly social engineering) or if could also work really well as a ducky script with some editing. 
When converting this to an .exe you can make it so it ask the user to run as admin and you will spawn a shell with admin privileges.
